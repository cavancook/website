                <p> Well, the way they make shows is, they make 
                    one show. That show's called a pilot. Then 
                    they show that show to the people who make 
                    shows, and on the strength of that one show 
                    they decide if they're going to make more 
                    shows. Some pilots get picked and become 
                    television programs. Some don't, become nothing. 
                    She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
